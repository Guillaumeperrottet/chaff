console.log("1. ‚úÖ Renamed `isCurrentYear` to `isEditable` for clarity");
console.log("2. ‚úÖ Set `isEditable={true}` - always allow editing in corresponding view");
console.log("3. ‚úÖ Removed system year restriction from handleSaveValue");
console.log("4. ‚úÖ Updated interface and all usages");

console.log("\nüéØ How to Test:");
console.log("1. Navigate to a mandate's CA page");
console.log("2. Select year 2023 from the dropdown");
console.log("3. Try to edit values - should work (they appear as 'current year')");
console.log("4. Select year 2024 from the dropdown");
console.log("5. Try to edit values - should work (they appear as 'current year')");
console.log("6. The year selector determines which data is editable");

console.log("\nüí° User Experience:");
console.log("- To edit 2023 data: Navigate to 2023 view where it appears as 'current year'");
console.log("- To edit 2024 data: Navigate to 2024 view where it appears as 'current year'");
console.log("- To edit 2025 data: Navigate to 2025 view where it appears as 'current year'");
console.log("- Previous year columns remain read-only for comparison");

console.log("\nüöÄ Implementation Complete!");
console.log("The editing logic now allows users to edit any year's data");
console.log("by navigating to the corresponding year view.");
